**VDG MILESTONE XIV – Paging & Print Mode Separation**

*Placeholder*

Goal  
Cleanly separate dense “view” rendering (for screen, full information) from paginated “print” mode (for output, spacious layouts).

Notes
- CLI and planner must branch cleanly between modes.
- Both modes require dedicated tests, fixtures, and documentation once scoped.
