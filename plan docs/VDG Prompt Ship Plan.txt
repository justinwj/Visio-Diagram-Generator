Prompt Delivery Plan:

1) prompt by prompt only deliver folders and files and code relevant to the prompt. 
	a. code from the previous prompt is not in the next prompt. 
	b. only folders, files and code relevant to the prompt is delivered.
	c. never re-ship earlier files and code unless we intentionally modify them 
	d. preserve folder and file structure while omitting folders and files and code not relevant to the prompt
	e. provide commentary e.g. “replace this file with…” or "add this file to..." or whatever makes sense.
