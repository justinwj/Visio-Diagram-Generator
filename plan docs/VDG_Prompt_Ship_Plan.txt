Prompt Delivery Plan (with improvements):

1) Deliver prompt by prompt — only folders/files/code relevant to the current prompt.
   a. Code from previous prompts is not re-shipped unless intentionally modified.
   b. Only folders/files/code relevant to the current prompt are delivered.
   c. Never re-ship earlier files/code unless explicitly modified.
   d. Preserve folder/file structure while omitting irrelevant items.
   e. Always provide commentary (e.g., “replace this file with…”, “add this file to…”).

2) Mark changes explicitly:
   • [N] = New file or folder introduced in this prompt.
   • [M] = Modified file from earlier prompt.

3) Integrity:
   • Provide SHA-256 checksum for each shipped file so the operator can verify integrity.

4) Clarity:
   • Tie each delivery explicitly to its Prompt number (e.g., “Prompt 5 Delivery Bundle”).
   • Commentary should list which files are New vs Modified, and why.

This ensures minimal, safe, and traceable deliveries across the multi-prompt workflow.
