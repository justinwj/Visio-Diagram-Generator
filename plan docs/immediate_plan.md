# Immediate Plan (delete below lists when done, this MD should not get long)

Based on the approved vision and the current project maturity (with stable semantics, planner integration, and golden validation now in place), the next highest-impact areas for Codex to tackle are:
	1. Stakeholder-Rich Review Feedback:
Implement enhanced CLI and report outputs that surface planner/semantic warnings and actionable summaries. This makes the new semantic foundation visible to users and reviewers, helping stakeholders quickly interpret subsystem splits, role bottlenecks, or pagination limits.
	2. Seed/Override File Integration:
Enable partial or full seed/override ingestion (e.g., for known team ownership, special module roles, or custom subsystems) so advanced users or stakeholders can tune classifications without retraining or changing heuristics. This further aligns the pipeline with the project’s "reviewable, deterministic, and extensible" vision.
	3. Advanced Layout and Flow Scenarios:
Extend the planner and renderer to gracefully visualize edge-case layouts—such as highly interconnected subsystems, dynamic call graphs, or multi-layer aggregates. This ensures even complex VBA workloads get readable, reviewable diagrams.
	4. Documentation and Reviewer Guidance:
Generate up-to-date vision-centric documentation (possibly automate extraction from golden artifacts/metadata) so future contributors and reviewers understand the classification pipeline, seed workflow, and semantic concepts with minimal onboarding friction.
